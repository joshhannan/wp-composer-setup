=========================================================================

Your Vagrant environment is now set up and ready to use, but you will
need to modify your system's host file in order to access it correctly.
Instructions on where and how to do this are beyond the scope of this
document. If you need help, please ask a coworker (or Google).

Your Vagrant server is running under a local subnet only accessible to
this computer. The IP address of the server is:

10.10.10.10

You will need to add a host file entry similar to one of the following
before you can access the server through your browser:

10.10.10.10 vagrant.local
10.10.10.10 somewebsite.local

Once this is done, you can access the Apache server by entering one of
the following in your browser:

http://vagrant.local
http://somewebsite.local

The Vagrant server comes with the latest build of phpMyAdmin available
for MySQL database management and access. You can access phpMyAdmin by
navigating to the /phpmyadmin path on any domain which is set up to
point to your Vagrant server. In the examples above, this would be:

http://vagrant.local/phpmyadmin
http://somewebsite.local/phpmyadmin

There is already a MySQL database set up for Magento, and if you had
the file {vagrant_root}/sql/latest.sql in place when you started this
environment, its contents are now contained in the database:

Database: magento
Username: magento
Password: <none>

You can initiate an SSH connection to the Vagrant environment using any
SSH client of your choice:

Hostname: 10.10.10.10
Username: vagrant
Password: vagrant

All emails sent out from within your Vagrant environment are captured
and relayed into a local email server which can be accessed via a
convenient webmail application. If you've properly set up your host
file per the instructions above, you should be able to access this
webmail interface using the following:

URL: http://vagrant.local/webmail
Username: vagrant
Password: vagrant

Happy Devving!
